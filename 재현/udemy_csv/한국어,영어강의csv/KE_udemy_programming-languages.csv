C# (pronounced see-sharp) is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. It was designed as a multi-paradigm programming language by Microsoft.
Thanks to the .NET framework, C# has many advantages over C++. C# is a refined and modernized version of C++. C++ was developed to bring object-orientation to C
Encapsulation can be used in C# to hide data and program behavior from users. With encapsulation, you can group properties, methods, and other members .
C# is a general-purpose programming language that you can use to build a wide range of programs and applications, such as web applications, Windows applications
As is true for many skills, you can learn C# by taking Udemy courses, reading documentation, and practicing coding hands-on.
